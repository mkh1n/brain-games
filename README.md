The game "Brain games" consists of several modules, each of which is a simple mathematical game.
Each game is started with a specific command. The player must give the correct answer three times in a row, otherwise the game will end.

* `brain-even` Number parity detection
* `brain-calc` Calculator game
* `brain-gcd` Finding the gratest common divisor of a pair of numbers
* `brain-progression` Detection of a missing link in the arithmetic progression
* `brain-prime` Prime number detection

## Installation and first launch ##

Clone repository to a local pc and run these commands in the root of the foder with game

	$ make install
  	$ sudo npm link

Congrats! Now you can run game commands in any directory of your PC.
